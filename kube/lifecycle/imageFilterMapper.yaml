# This file maps image filter parameter names to the image names used for dxLatestImageTagExtract()
# An image filter parameter usually is contructed as: EXAMPLE_IMAGE_FILTER 
# Where EXAMPLE is the image name and _IMAGE_FILTER is the filter suffix.
# By default the suffix _IMAGE_FILTER is cut off and the remaining part is set to lower case (i.e. example)
# and used as image name to the filter. If this doesn't fit this file can provide individual mappings for
# filter parameter names to image names.

imageFilterNames:
  EXAMPLE_IMAGE_FILTER: "example2"
